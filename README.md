The Login box must be centered in the screen and stay in the center of the screen even as you resize the web-browser.
This should be relatively easily acomplished with flexbox.
The login box should have a minimum size, and the input fields or text in the box should not leak out of the box.
The login box should have box-shadow and rounded edges.

The login box should have a button.
